# Project: Cleaning of Marketing Campaign Dataset for Pulse380 Advertising

This repository demonstrates practical techniques for cleaning and preparing raw datasets using Advancedn functions in Microsoft Excel.

## üìå Overview

Raw data is most times messy, an example of such data is the marketing campain dataset from Pulse360 Advertising. It is rare to get a dataset that‚Äôs
‚Äúanalysis-ready‚Äù right out of the box. This data include missing values, duplicate rows, weird symbols, misaligned columns, inconsistent dates... the
list goes on. Effective data cleaning is a vital part of the data analytics process and it does takes a lot of time. In this project, 
I used Excel to clean a messy dataset from Pulse380 Advertising, using tools and formulas commonly used in real-world scenarios.

## Issues with marketing Campaign data for Pulse380 Advertising
The Pulse-360 Advertising marketing campaign dataset comprises over 99,000 rows of raw data, capturing a wide range of performance metrics across
diverse audience segments. However, the dataset presents several challenges, including missing values, inconsistencies, duplicates, and formatting
issues ‚Äî all of which can compromise the accuracy of any analysis. If left unaddressed, these issues may lead to misleading insights, flawed decision
making, and reduced effectiveness in optimizing future campaigns. Therefore, thorough data cleaning and preprocessing are critical steps to ensure
the dataset is reliable and ready for meaningful analysis.

## Objectives of the Project

* Perform comprehensive data cleaning to prepare the marketing campaign performance dataset for accurate analysis.
* Identify and resolve missing values, duplicate records, and data inconsistencies.
* Standardize data formats across all columns to ensure consistency and integrity.
* Correct errors and harmonize values within categorical fields.
