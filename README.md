# Project: Cleaning of Marketing Campaign Dataset for Pulse380 Advertising


## üìå Overview

Raw data is usually messy, an example of such data is the marketing campaign performance dataset from Pulse360 Advertising. It is rare to get a
dataset that‚Äôs ‚Äúanalysis-ready‚Äù right out of the box. This data include missing values, duplicate rows, weird symbols, misaligned columns,
inconsistent dates... the list goes on. 
Effective data cleaning is a vital part of the data analytics process and it does takes a lot of time. In this project, I demonstrated practical
techniques for cleaning and preparing raw datasets using Advanced functions in Microsoft Excel.

## Issues With Marketing Campaign Performance Data At Pulse380 Advertising
The Pulse-360 Advertising marketing campaign dataset comprises over 99,000 rows and 16 columns of raw data, capturing a wide range of performance
metrics across diverse audience segments. Columns in the data include includes fields such as Campaign Type, Campaign ID, Company, Target Audience,
Durations, Channels Used, Conversion Rate, Acquisition Cost, ROI, Impressions, Location, and Customer Segment.  However, the dataset presents several
challenges, including missing values, inconsistencies, duplicates, and formatting issues ‚Äî all of which can compromise the accuracy of any analysis.
If left unaddressed, these issues may lead to misleading insights, flawed decision making, and reduced effectiveness in optimizing future campaigns.
Therefore, thorough data cleaning and preprocessing are critical steps to ensure the dataset is reliable and ready for meaningful analysis.

## Objectives of the Project

* Perform comprehensive data cleaning to prepare the marketing campaign performance dataset for accurate analysis.
* Identify and resolve missing values, duplicate records, and data inconsistencies.
* Standardize data formats across all columns to ensure consistency and integrity.
* Correct errors and harmonize values within categorical fields.
* Enhance overall data quality to enable reliable, insightful analysis of campaign performance.

‚úÖ Key Cleaning Tasks Covered

‚úÖ Removing Duplicates: 
  Ensured the integrity of the dataset and prevents skewed results.

‚úÖ Handling Missing Values: 
  Decided whether to remove, replace, or interpolate missing data as it could significantly affect insights.

‚úÖ Data Type Validation: 
  Ensured  consistency in formats (dates, numbers, text) to avoid analysis errors.

‚úÖ Used Functions: 
  Perfected the tidying up if messy data entries. Below are some of the functions I used: 

  ‚ú® TRIM() ‚Äì Removes extra spaces that often cause hidden errors.

  ‚ú® SUBSTITUTE() ‚Äì Replaces unwanted characters like commas or special symbols.

  ‚ú® CLEAN() ‚Äì Clears non-printable characters, especially useful when importing data from external sources.
 
 ‚ú® LEFT(), RIGHT(), MID() ‚Äì Extract specific parts of text for standardization.
 ‚ú® FIND() & SEARCH() ‚Äì Locate text within strings (with SEARCH being case-insensitive).
 ‚ú® VALUE() ‚Äì Converts text to numbers, essential for accurate calculations.

 ‚ú® TEXT() ‚Äì Formats numbers and dates for consistency across the dataset.

 ‚ú® ISBLANK() ‚Äì Identifies missing entries that need attention.

 ‚ú® IF(), IFS(), AND(), OR() ‚Äì Apply conditional logic to clean or categorize data.. 

- Splitted and combined columns where necessary 

- Used filters and conditional formatting


## ‚úÖ Outcome

After cleaning, the dataset is:
- Free of duplicates and empty rows
- Standardized in format and structure
- Ready for use in dashboards, segmentation, or modeling
